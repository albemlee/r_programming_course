# Who is this book for?

As the title suggests, I created this content for folks who do data analysis (e.g., Excel or Google Spreadsheets) and do not consider themselves a "computer programmer." Not all analysts need to become a data scientist or software engineer, but we all can benefit from learning some computer programming skills and expand the sophistication of the analysis we do. This book is meant to be a gentle starting point.

# Acknowledgement

The topics covered in this book are heavily based on the *R for Everyone* and *R for Data Manipulation* workshops I taught during my time working for UCSF library.
