# Who is this book for?

This book is for people who work with data using tools like Excel or Google Sheets but don’t consider themselves computer programmers. Not every analyst needs to become a data scientist or software engineer. Still, nearly all of us can benefit from learning a bit of programming to deepen and extend the kinds of analyses we can do.  

This book is designed as a gentle, accessible starting point.

# Acknowledgement

The topics covered in this book are heavily based on the *R for Everyone* and *R for Data Manipulation* workshops I taught during my time working for UCSF library.
